I am a PhD student at Bar-Ilan University under the guidance of [Prof. Gilad Asharov](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~asharog/). 
I have a strong interest in mathematics and theoretical computer science. Specifically, my interests lie in cryptography and secure
multi-party computation.

Prior to this, I completed an integrated Masters in Computer Science from the International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore.
My master's thesis was on "Unconditionally-Secure MPC with Dynamic Participation" where I was extremely fortunate to be guided by
[Prof. Ashish Choudhury](https://sites.google.com/view/ashish-choudhury) and [Prof. Arpita Patra](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arpita/).
I was also a research associate at the [CrIS Lab](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~cris/people.html), IISc Bangalore from September 2021 to April 2022.

I am a violinist, practicing _Indian Carnatic_ classical music. I also enjoy watching and playing football and chess. Feel free to drop me a challenge on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/ani_gator) or
[Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/zurajanaii). And finally, checkout my [art journal](https://anirudh-c.github.io/art-journal).
